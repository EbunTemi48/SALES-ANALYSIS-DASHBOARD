 ## RECOMMENDATION

1. Focus marketing and customer loyalty programs on **adult and senior** customers.
 
2. Region like **Central and southeast** show low revenue. The business can run location-specific promotions like “Weekend Deals” or pop-up ads for customers in those regions to drive more sales.
 
3. Countries where female customers are contributing less, create targeted campaigns like special bundles or referral bonuses for women to increase engagement.
 
4. Analyze what’s working in top-performing regions (like **Australia**) . Is it product selection, pricing, or marketing strategy? Apply those insight to lift performance in other countries.
